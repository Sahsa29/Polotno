			<h3>ADVICE OF GREAT ARTISTS</h2>
		<h3>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&#9733;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h3>
			<div class="text">
	 <p class="put">There is a stereotype that claims that not everyone can become an artist. But this is not so, because any person can learn to draw, only it is necessary to put the proper amount of effort. Unfortunately, most young artists make the same mistakes during their inexperience. To help you avoid them, we have collected the best, in our opinion, advice. Listen to them, because every artist went through the stage of "rake", so these tips - nothing like accumulated knowledge on someone else's experience
	 If you are just a beginner artist, think about what the point is that you paint. Think about what you have to say to others through your creativity.</p> 
	  <p class="put"> There must be something more that you can give people.
	For a long time already there was no need to accurately draw the surrounding world - cameras and cameras appeared. Artists have the freedom to paint abstractly, and in general everything that wags into the head. So take this opportunity, And here we mean not only those people who can practically help you in your field of activity. Every creative person knows that feeling when certain people somehow have a depressing effect on inspiration and the ability to create. Think about the evening with a can of beer and flat humor among such people that you can not then pick yourself up.</p>
